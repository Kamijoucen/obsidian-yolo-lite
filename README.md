# OpenYOLO

English | [中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

OpenYOLO is an AI note assistant plugin for Obsidian (desktop only). The plugin itself contains no agent or model implementation — instead, it connects to [opencode](https://opencode.ai) as its backend via the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (ACP), and provides a chat interface in the sidebar. Model access, tool execution, session history and memory are all maintained natively by opencode.

## Features

- **Chat**: streaming output, collapsible reasoning, tool-call cards (read/write/edit/terminal/search, with diff preview for edits), plan panel
- **Context awareness**: automatically attaches the currently open note; attach multiple vault notes via the attachment panel, or add external text files / images (paste supported)
- **Permission approvals**: tool permission requests shown as cards (allow once / always allow / reject); optional YOLO mode auto-approves everything
- **Mode switching**: plan (read-only) / build (writable), mapped to opencode session modes
- **Model & effort selection**: searchable list of all models configured in opencode; selections are persisted and restored across restarts (falls back to the first model if the saved one disappears)
- **Slash commands**: type `/` to invoke opencode commands / skills
- **History**: automatically restores the most recent session; browse all persisted sessions
- **Note-assistant prompt**: maintains a managed block in the vault-root `AGENTS.md` to guide opencode toward note-centric work; editable or disable-able in settings

## How it works

```
Obsidian plugin (ACP client)  ──stdio / JSON-RPC──▶  opencode acp (subprocess)
```

- Spawns `opencode acp` as a subprocess and communicates via the official `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`
- Sessions are persisted by opencode; the plugin replays history via `session/list` + `session/load`
- Attachments are sent as ACP `resource_link` blocks and read natively by opencode
- File access (`fs/read_text_file` / `fs/write_text_file`) is implemented through the vault adapter, strictly confined to the vault root
- Permission requests (`session/request_permission`) are routed to in-plugin approval cards
- The UI is a React-rendered ItemView; `session/update` notifications are mapped to immutable state for streaming rendering

## Prerequisites

1. Install opencode: `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`
2. Configure a model provider: `opencode auth login`
3. Desktop only (requires Node subprocess capability)

## Installation

Copy `manifest.json`, `main.js` and `styles.css` into `.obsidian/plugins/openyolo/` of your vault, then enable OpenYOLO in "Settings → Community plugins".

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # watch build
npm run build      # production build
npm run type:check && npm run lint:check && npm test   # quality gates
```
